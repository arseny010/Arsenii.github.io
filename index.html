<h2><strong>The Ideals of Ruby’s Creator</strong></h2>
Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto, blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.

He has often said that he is “trying to make Ruby natural, not simple,” in a way that mirrors life.

<h3>Actual site</h3>
<a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">about</a>

The main focus of this site is to represent Ruby language and it executes it well. 
The site is easy to navigate. I like the simple design. Also this site has been written in many languages which makes it accessible almost for anybody.
